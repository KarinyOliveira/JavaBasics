## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KarinyOliveira/JavaBasics.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd JavaBasics
   ```
3. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or use a text editor and compile the code using the command line.

4. Start with any exercise you'd like, modify the code, and run it to test your understanding.

## Setup Instructions

### Requirements:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 8 or higher
- A Java-friendly IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, NetBeans) or a text editor with Java support
- **MySQL (or any preferred database)** for JDBC exercises (optional for database-related tasks)

### Steps:

1. Download and install the latest JDK from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
2. Ensure Java is correctly installed by running the following in your terminal:
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```
   You should see the installed version number.

3. Open the exercises in your Java IDE or compile them via command line:
   ```bash
   javac filename.java
   java filename
   ```

4. For JDBC exercises:
   - Ensure you have a database setup (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
   - Configure the database connection with proper credentials in the exercise code.
   - You may need to add the JDBC driver to your project (e.g., MySQL Connector for Java).
